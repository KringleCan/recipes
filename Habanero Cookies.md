# Habanero Cookies
I made it and was surprised at how diminished the heat is.
Without the heat these cookies really bring forward that wonderful habanero flavor.

## Ingredients
 * 10 Habanero peppers, seeded and minced
 * 1 1/2 cups sugar
 * 1 cup softened butter
 * 1 tsp vanilla extract
 * 2 eggs
 * 2 3/4 cups flour
 * 1 tsp baking soda
 * 1 tsp salt

## Directions
 1. Preheat oven at 325Â°F
 1. Cream butter and sugar together
 1. Mix to combine eggs one at a time
 1. Mix in vanilla and habanero
 1. In a separate bowl, Mix the dry: flour, baking soda, and salt
 1. Add the dry mix into the wet a cup at a time and mix
 1. Dollop on sheet pans and bake for 12 - 16 minutes or until the cookies just start to take on a bit of color.

## Notes
 * These cookies are cake like texture.
 * The habanero flavor is a bit delicate. If you brown the cookies too much then it may overpower the flavor.
