# Panera's Broccoli Cheddar Soup

Servings: 6
Prep time: 10 min.
Cook time: 25 min.
Total time: 35 min.

## Ingredients
- 1/4 cup of melted butter
- 1/4 cup of all purpose flour
- 2 cups of half & half
- 2 cups of low-sodium chicken stock or broth
- 1/2 lb of broccoli (about 3 cups), chopped into bite size pieces
- 1 cup of shredded carrots
- 1/4 tsp of nutmeg (optional but brings out the flavor)
- 8 ounces of grated sharp cheddar cheese (2 cups)
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions
1. Melt the butter and sprinkle the flour over it. Cook and stir over medium heat for 1-2 minutes.
2. Whisk in the half & half and chicken stock.
3. Add the broccoli and carrots. Cook over low heat for 20-25 minutes or until the broccoli and carrots are tender.
4. Add salt and pepper. You can leave the soup chunky or blend about 1 cup of the soup and stir it in for a smoother soup (that's what I do). Return to low heat and add the cheese. If your heat is too high your soup can get grainy. Stir in the nutmeg if desired.
5. Serve with crusty bread.
