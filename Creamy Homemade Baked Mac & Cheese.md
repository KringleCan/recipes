Servings: 8
Prep time: 20 min.
Cook time: 15 min.
Total time: 35 min.

## Ingredients
- 1 lb elbow pasta
- 1 stick of unsalted butter (1/2 cup)
- 1/2 cup of all purpose flour
- 1 1/2 cups of milk
- 2 1/2 cups half & half
- 6 cups of various shredded cheeses
  - Preference towards sharp cheddar and pepper jack
- 1/2 tablespoon of salt
- 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon of paprika

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 325Â°F.
2. Boil pasta for 4-5 minutes, place in a bowl off to the side.
3. Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Sprinkle in flour and whisk to combine. Mixture will look like very wet sand. Cook for approximately 1 minute, whisking often. Slowly pour in about 2 cups or so of the half and half, while whisking constantly, until smooth. Slowly pour in the remaining half and half and the whole milk, while whisking constantly, until combined and smooth.
4. Continue to heat over medium heat, whisking very often, until thickened to a very thick consistency. It should almost be the consistency of a semi thinned out condensed soup.
5. Remove from the heat and stir in spices and 1 1/2 cups of the cheeses, stirring to melt and combine. Stir in another 1 1/2 cups of cheese, and stir until completely melted and smooth.
6. In a large mixing bowl, combine drained pasta with cheese sauce, stirring to combine fully.
7. Pour half of the pasta mixture into the prepared baking dish. Top with 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheese. Repeat with remaining pasta and shredded cheese.
9. Bake for 15 minutes, until cheesy is bubbly and lightly golden brown
